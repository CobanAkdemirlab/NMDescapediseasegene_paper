# NMDesc

These codes aim to annotate and analyze the **PTC variants from Clinvar** by whether they escape from Nonsense Medicated Decay(NMD) using canonical rules(EJC model). **Gene, variant, and protein level features** are extracted from multiple data source. 

To use the codes, **Clinvar_step1_NMD.R and Clinvar_step2_NMD.R** should be the first R scripts to run.

For **different analyse**:

plus1_variants was used to create plus1 fasta files 

plus1_variants was used to create vcf files.

The fasta files are input for idr and AF2 analyse

The vcf files are input for vep analysis
