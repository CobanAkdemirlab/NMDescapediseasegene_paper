We analyze idr in 3 ways to see the association between the pathogencity of NMDesc variants and their IDDR region:

**IDR length difference** between WT and mutated variants

WT and mutated varants' **IDR overlap with canonical NMDesc region**

If any **variant is after the start of WT IDR region**.
