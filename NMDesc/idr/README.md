We analyze **Intrinsically Disordered Regions(IDRs)** in 3 ways to see the association between the pathogencity of NMDesc variants and their IDR region:

1. **IDR length difference** between WT and mutated variants

2. WT and mutated varants' **IDR overlap with canonical NMDesc region**

3. If any **variant is after the start of WT IDR region**.
